# Kesha v3.0 very early (aka Jarvis update)
Simple Voice Assistant made as an experiment using [Silero](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) & [Vosk](https://pypi.org/project/vosk/).
<br>Later on [Picovoice Porcupine Wake Word Detection](https://picovoice.ai/platform/porcupine/) & [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) was added.

`The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.`

# Installation
First, install the requirements, the file is just a `pip freeze`.<br>
Second, check `config.py` and set required values.<br>
Next, just run the `main.py` script.<br><br>

And don't forget to put models of Vosk to main folder.<br>
You can get the latest from the [official website.](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
<br>The one I was using is `small`.
